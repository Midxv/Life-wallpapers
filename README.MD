# Midwalls - Life in Pixels

Midwalls is a smart, minimalist live wallpaper for Android that visualizes your time as a grid of dots. It helps you stay conscious of your goals by tracking the progress of your year, month, week, or a custom deadline directly on your home screen.

## ✨ Features

- **Smart Progress Tracking:** Automatically calculates how many days have passed based on your goal (1 Year, 1 Month, 1 Week, or Custom).
- **Battery Efficient:** Uses an event-driven architecture. The wallpaper only redraws when the screen turns on or settings change. Zero background battery drain.
- **Drag & Drop Editor:** A full WYSIWYG editor to position your quote and grid exactly where you want them.
- **Immersive Customization:**
    - Change dot shapes (Circle/Square).
    - Adjust dot sizes and box stroke width.
    - Set custom backgrounds (Solid colors or Images).
    - Hide elements you don't need (Text or Box).
- **Auto-Quotes:** Displays a daily motivational quote, or lets you write your own.
